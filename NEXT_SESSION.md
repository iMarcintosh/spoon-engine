- Serialize texture paths and material properties
- Restore complete material state on load
- Support for different material types

**Technical Requirements**:
- Material introspection system
- Enhanced JSON structure for materials
- Asset path resolution for textures
- Material recreation system

**Estimated Effort**: Low-Medium (1 focused session)

## üóìÔ∏è Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Sessions)

### **Editor Polish & Usability**
1. **Gizmos & Transform Handles** - Visual 3D manipulation tools for position/rotation/scale
2. **Grid Rendering System** - Visual reference grid for 3D viewport with snap-to-grid
3. **JSON Library Integration** - Replace basic string parsing with nlohmann/json
4. **Entity Selection Improvements** - Multi-select, outlining, better visual feedback
5. **Properties Panel Enhancement** - More component types, better UI layout

### **Asset Pipeline Extensions**
1. **Texture Asset Integration** - Proper texture management in asset browser
2. **Model Format Extensions** - Basic GLTF support alongside existing OBJ
3. **Asset Dependency Tracking** - Know which entities use which assets
4. **Asset Import Pipeline** - Standardized asset processing workflow

### **Editor Performance & Stability**
1. **Error Handling Improvements** - Better crash recovery and user feedback
2. **Memory Management** - Proper cleanup for dynamically created entities
3. **Viewport Performance** - Optimization for large scenes
4. **Auto-save Functionality** - Periodic scene backup system

- **Animation Timeline** - Keyframe animation support
- **Level Design Tools** - Terrain, lighting, environment tools
- **Asset Store Integration** - Import/export asset packages
- **Collaborative Editing** - Multi-user scene editing

### **Engine Core Enhancements**
- **C# Scripting Integration** - Mono/.NET runtime for game logic and behavior scripting
- **Additional Render Backends** - Vulkan, DirectX, Metal support
- **PBR Material System** - Physically Based Rendering implementation
- **Audio System** - 3D spatial audio with various format support
- **Physics Integration** - Bullet Physics or custom collision detection
- **Networking Foundation** - Multiplayer game support

### **Development Workflow**
- **Asset Streaming** - Large world support with LOD
- **Hot-Reloading** - Live shader/asset updates during development
- **Profiling Tools** - Performance analysis and optimization
- **Deployment Pipeline** - Build and distribution automation

## üìù Development Notes & Technical Decisions

### **Architecture Patterns Established**
- **ECS Design**: Data-oriented component storage with system-based processing
- **Renderer Abstraction**: Backend-agnostic rendering interface for multi-API support
- **Asset Management**: Centralized loading with smart pointer caching and factory patterns
- **Editor Integration**: ImGui-based immediate mode UI with embedded viewport rendering

### **Key Technical Decisions Made**
1. **Scene Serialization**: JSON format chosen for human readability and extensibility
2. **File Management**: Cross-platform C++ filesystem for robust path handling
3. **Component Architecture**: Separate Transform/MeshRenderer/CameraComponent structure
4. **Editor Viewport**: Framebuffer-based embedded rendering for real-time preview
5. **Material System**: Shader + uniform abstraction with Material::Create factory pattern

### **Known Limitations to Address**
- Basic JSON parsing (needs proper library integration)
- Limited material introspection (hard to extract actual colors)
- No entity relationships or parent/child hierarchies
- Single camera support in editor
- Basic error handling in some asset loading paths

### **Code Quality Notes**
- Modern C++17 patterns consistently used
- RAII for all resource management
- Clear separation between engine core and editor
- Professional naming conventions maintained
- Comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md

## ‚ö° Quick Start for Next Session

### **First Commands to Run**
```bash
cd /Users/marc/Projects/claude/spoon-engine
ls -la scenes/  # Check saved scene files
./build/bin/SpoonEditor  # Test current editor state
```

### **Key Files to Examine**
- `Editor/main.cpp` - Main editor implementation with scene management
- `Engine/Include/SpoonEngine/Assets/SceneSerializer.h` - Serialization interface
- `Engine/Source/Assets/SceneSerializer.cpp` - JSON save/load implementation
- `scenes/` directory - Saved scene files for testing

### **Context to Remember**
1. **Scene serialization is complete** - All 5 entities now save/load correctly
2. **Editor has working file dialogs** - Save As/Open Scene fully functional
3. **Path resolution works cross-platform** - Project root detection implemented
4. **Material system is established** - Shader + Material factory pattern in place
5. **ECS architecture is stable** - Component registration and system management working

### **Immediate Tasks for Asset Browser**
1. Research ImGui file browser widgets or plan custom implementation
2. Design asset panel layout in editor UI
3. Plan texture preview rendering system
4. Consider asset metadata storage approach
5. Design drag-drop workflow for texture application
